# facemask-object-detection
An object detection project which detects face masks in a picture using **Keras** and **Tensorflow**. Object detection is a computer technology 
related to computer vision and image processing that deals with detecting instances of semantic objects of a certain class in digital images and videos.

## Pre-requisites

Create a python virtual environment using:
```bash
python -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment
```

Then, fork the code and place it in the root folder.

Next, activate the virtual environment using (Windows):
```bash
Scripts/activate
```

Check https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html for more details.

After the virtual environment is activated, install the dependencies needed using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
